# Speech Emotion Recognition 🎭🔍  
A deep learning-based system for real-time facial emotion recognition using OpenCV and TensorFlow.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Dataset Creation**: Captures facial expressions and organizes them into labeled datasets.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses **MobileNetV2** for feature extraction and classification.  
- **Emotion Detection in Video**: Identifies emotions in real-time video streams.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances training data with transformations for better accuracy.  
- **Interactive UI**: Displays real-time facial expression detection results.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python, TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning  
- **OpenCV** for face detection and video processing  
- **scikit-learn** for preprocessing and classification  
- **MobileNetV2** for transfer learning
